# About the project


Do you think that making a robot is difficult and expensive? No, it’s not entirely true. Yes, creating a robot from scratch requires a lot of knowledge. But modern frameworks can significantly speed up this process. The most time and effort is spent creating a platform — the physical design of the robot, selecting or developing electronics, and setting up the first movements.

The goal of this project is to create a robot platform that can be easily repeated and assembled independently. Having a ready-made platform should lower the threshold for entering the exciting world of robotics. The complexity of the first steps can scare off many interested parties, but if a person has a platform that can work in just a few days, it will definitely attract more interested parties.

Imagine: in a few days you assemble a robot that, like a robot vacuum cleaner, can map your house and move around it from point A to point B, avoiding obstacles. Interesting, right?

The next goal of this project is to create a student community around this platform that will develop it and carry out their own projects based on it, expanding and scaling its capabilities.
