# About the project

Do you think that making a robot is difficult and expensive? No, it's not quite true. Yes, creating a robot requires a lot of knowledge from the basics. But modern frameworks can significantly speed up this process. Most of the time and effort is spent on creating the platform - the physical structure of the robot, selecting or developing the electronics, and setting up the first movements.

The goal of this project is to create a robot platform that can be easily replicated and assembled by yourself. Having a ready-made platform should lower the threshold for entering the fascinating world of robotics. The complexity of the first steps can scare off many people, but if a person has a platform that can start working in a few days, it will definitely attract more people.

Just imagine: in a few days, you assemble a robot that, like a robot vacuum cleaner, can map your home and move around it from point A to point B, avoiding obstacles. Sounds interesting, doesn't it?

The next goal of this project is to create a student community around this platform that will develop it and carry out their own projects based on it, expanding and scaling its capabilities.
