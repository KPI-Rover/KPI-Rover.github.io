# The project roadmap

|#| Step|Description|
|--- | --- |--- |
| 1 | **Development of the robot chassis** | - Creation of an easy-to-manufacture chassis design with four motors, each equipped with an encoder for measuring the speed of rotation of the wheels. <br/> - Development of a motor controller based on STM32 with control via a serial interface. |
| 2 | **Integration of ROS2 and control via Bluetooth Gamepad** | Setting up the minimum configuration of ROS2 on Raspberry Pi to control the robot chassis using a standard Bluetooth joystick. |
| 3 | **Launching indoor navigation using lidar** | Selecting and configuring one of the ROS2 frameworks to create a map of the room and autonomous movement between points A and B. |
| 4 | **Launching outdoor navigation using GPS** | Selecting and configuring one of the ROS2 frameworks that will provide autonomous navigation along specified waypoints using GPS. |
| 5 | **Implementation of indoor navigation using only the camera** | Selection of an appropriate framework for implementing navigation using only the camera to create a room map and autonomous movement. |
| 6 | **Launch of profile projects** | Start of work on specialized projects based on a ready-made robot platform with expansion of its capabilities. |
